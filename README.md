## Inspiration
As a space to present projects and tidbits of ideas, having a board-like theme for the website seemed to be appropriate. This site is to serve as a continuously growing collection of heres and theres.

At the moment, the website utilizes HTML and CSS (projects themselves include some JavaScript), with some applicaton of the [BEM methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/css/) for CSS classes, albeit imperfect. Regardless, it has proven most useful in creating the various elements on my website board.
