    <p id="salutations">Hello there, I am Angelica Munyao,</p>
    <p id="prof-1">an aspiring user experience designer and website developer currently pursuing a master's degree in human-computer interaction at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and computer science from St. Lawrence University.</p>
    <p id="prof-2">My work experience thus far has driven me to the field of human-computer interaction, as it stirred my curiosity about customer experiences with software products and the impact of these experiences on the success of a business:<br /><br />
      <span class="list-items">I have worked as a student technician and later student manager for the IT help desk at St. Lawrence University for over 2 years, during which I have interacted with various customers and worked to cater to their particular service needs,</span>
      <span class="list-items">I have worked under a product manager for an internship with US Auto Parts Network Inc, during which I collected customer feedback and website trend data to inform the development of a customer journey map for the company's e-commerce website,</span>
      <span class="list-items">I have designed and developed a website using WordPress for the St. Lawrence County Community Development Program to provide information more conveniently to community members regarding the programs it offers.</span>
      <br />
      Through these experiences, a foundational comprehension of the aspects involved in providing a satisfactory customer experience evolved, and as I continue to seek further understanding through the field of human-computer interaction I look forward to new insight each step of the way.
    </p>
    <p id="prof-3">This website serves as a profile on which my academic and professional experiences, as well as personal interests may be viewed by peers and potential employers.</p>
