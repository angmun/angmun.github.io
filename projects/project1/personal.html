      <p>I am a fan of poetry as a medium of emotional expression. While I cannot claim adeptness, it is an area I am most keen to explore and develop a skill in. <br />One of my favorite classes during my undergraduate study was an introductory poetry class in my senior year. I retained the assigned course book with an intention to continue writing and learning. <br /> Through the Tiger Tales Toastmasters club in RIT, I have a platform to practice my writing and performace skills. The feedback received from fellow toastmasters and guests is most assistive to this process.</p>

    <p>I enjoy drawing and am developing my skills in utilizing software tools such as Inkscape to create images, background tiles and icons. Whenever time allows, I opt to create a customized icon for a website rather than seek out free icons online. The logo and icon for my website are examples of my work. My <a href="https://angmun.github.io" target="_blank">website hosted on Github</a> has a different logo and icon to view.</p>

    <p>I have had an interest in designing clothing and accessories, primarily for women, since I was a young girl. At that time I would stitch outfits for dolls, but after taking homescience in highschool, I eventually began to work on outfits for people. <br />
      I regularly alter clothing for myself, family and friends, either to improve the fit or add some aesthetic features. Occassionally, I work on accessories and outfits when I find the time. Stitching can be a most therapeutic activity for me.</p>
